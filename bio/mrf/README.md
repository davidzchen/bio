# MRF Library

This directory contains utilities for working with Mapped Read Format (MRF)
files.

Unfortunately, there is no formal specification of the MRF format. The format is
briefly described and illustrated in the [RSEQTools][rseqtools] paper and on its
[documentation][rseqtools-docs].

This implementation is based on the reference [libmrf][libmrf] implementation
but with additional validation added.
